Sentinel-2 Deep Resolution 

The S2DR3 model, or Sentinel-2 Deep Resolution 3.0, was introduced in October 2023 by Yosef Akhtman . It is a significant advancement over its predecessor, S2DR2, which was released in late 2022. S2DR3 employs an artificial neural network architecture to upscale all 12 spectral bands of a Sentinel-2 L2A scene from the original 10, 20, and 60 meters per pixel to a target resolution of 1 meter per pixel.
